# Lecture 1: Introduction to Concepts of Probability and Statistics

## Topics covered:

* What is the difference between *descriptive* and *inferential* statistics? Be able to correctly identify examples of each.

* What is the difference between a *population* and a *sample*? Be able to correctly identify the population of interest for a hypothetical research question or application.

* Measurement scales:
     * What is the difference between *categorical / qualitative* and *quantitative* variables? 
     * What is the difference between a *nominal, ordinal, interval* and *ratio* scale? What is a *dichotomous* variable? What is a *Likert scale*?
     * What is the difference between a *discrete* and *continuous* variable? 
     * Be able to talk about measurement in two ways: (1) features of the underlying *property* being measured; (2) the scale of the measurement tool used. For example, we often use a discrete scale to measure a property that is continuous (e.g. height, measured to the nearest inch).

* Be able to identify the measurement scale of a variable using the above descriptors. I will choose relatively unambiguous examplesâ€”but if you believe there is ambiguity, provide a short rationale for your answer.

* What is *simple random sampling*? What are its primary advantages and disadvantages? What do the letters *n* and *N* designate?

* What is a *sampling frame*? What is it used for? 

* What is the difference between a *nonprobability* sampling method and probability sampling? What is *sampling bias*?

* What are *cluster* and *stratified* sampling methods? Why might someone wish to use one of these methods instead of simple random sampling?
