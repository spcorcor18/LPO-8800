## Lecture 1: Introduction to Concepts of Probability and Statistics

* What is the difference between <em>descriptive</em> and <em>inferential</em> statistics? Be able to correctly identify examples of each.

* What is the difference between a <em>population</em> and a <em>sample</em>? Be able to correctly identify the population of interest for a hypothetical research question or application.

* Measurement scales:
     * What is the difference between <em>categorical / qualitative</em> and <em>quantitative</em> variables? 
     * What is the difference between a <em>nominal, ordinal, interval</em> and <em>ratio</em> scale? What is a <em>dichotomous</em> variable? What is a <em>Likert scale</em>?
     * What is the difference between a <em>discrete</em> and <em>continuous</em> variable? 
     * Be able to talk about measurement in two ways: (1) features of the underlying <em>property</em> being measured; (2) the scale of the measurement tool used. For example, we often use a discrete scale to measure a property that is continuous (e.g. height, measured to the nearest inch).

* Be able to identify the measurement scale of a variable using the above descriptors. I will choose relatively unambiguous examplesâ€”but if you believe there is ambiguity, provide a short rationale for your answer.

* What is <em>simple random sampling</em>? What are its primary advantages and disadvantages? What do the letters <em>n</em> and <em>N</em> designate?

* What is a <em>sampling frame</em>? What is it used for? 

* What is the difference between a <em>nonprobability</em> sampling method and probability sampling? What is <em>sampling bias</em>?

* What are <em>cluster</em> and <em>stratified</em> sampling methods? Why might someone wish to use one of these methods instead of simple random sampling?
