## Lecture 2: Describing Univariate Distributions (I)

* Basic commands in Stata: refer to the "Stata Basics" handout on Github, and watch the Crash Course in Stata video

* Describing categorical data:
	* Know what <em>frequency</em> and <em>relative frequency</em> (percent) distributions tell you about the distribution of a variable; know to produce and read these in Stata.
	* For what kinds of measures would you most likely produce a frequency (or relative frequency) distribution?
	* How can one use the <em>cumulative percent</em> column in a Stata table? For what kinds of measures is it useful/appropriate?
	* How can one determine in Stata how many observations have <em>missing values</em> of a particular variable?
	* Know how to read a <em>bar graph</em> (frequency or percent), and how to produce one in Stata. For what kind of measure is a bar graph appropriate?
	* Know how to read a <em>pie graph</em>, and how to produce one. For what kind of measure is a pie graph appropriate?
	* What do the terms <em>mutually exclusive</em> and <em>collectively exhaustive</em> mean?

* Describing quantitative data:
	* Know how to read a <em>histogram</em>, and how to produce one in Stata. For what kind of measure is a histogram appropriate? For what kind of variable is a histogram not appropriate?
	* Know how to read a <em>stem-and-leaf</em> display, and how to produce one in Stata.
	* What is a <em>symmetric distribution</em>? What does it mean for a distribution to be <em>right skewed</em> or <em>left skewed</em>? Be able to recognize symmetry/skewness from a histogram (and later, from a boxplot).

* Central tendency:
	* Know how the following measures are defined, and be prepared to calculate them, given relevant data: <em>mean, median, mode</em>. Also know how to find these using Stata.
	* Know when the use of each central tendency measure is appropriate to use.
	* How does one take a weighted average of group means to find the overall mean? 
	* What does the mean of a <em>dichotomous</em> (0-1) variable tell you?
	* When will the median of a distribution be smaller than its mean? Larger than its mean? Be able to identify such cases in a histogram, boxplot, or other distributional graph.

* Variation/dispersion:
	* Know how the following measures are defined, and be prepared to calculate them, given relevant data: <em>range, interquartile range, variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation</em> (you will not have to calculate the variance or standard deviation manually from raw data on an exam). Know how to find these using Stata.
	* Know when the use of each measure of variability above is an appropriate measure to use. 

* What is an <em>outlier</em>? In practice, how should one deal with outliers? What are the considerations?

* Basic properties of the summation operator; carrying out a double summation
