# Lecture 2: Describing Univariate Distributions (I)

## Topics covered:

* Basic commands in Stata: refer to the "Stata Basics" handout on Github, and watch the Crash Course in Stata video

* Describing categorical data:
	* Know what *frequency* and *relative frequency* (percent) distributions tell you about the distribution of a variable; know to produce and read these in Stata.
	* For what kinds of measures would you most likely produce a frequency (or relative frequency) distribution?
	* How can one use the *cumulative percent* column in a Stata table? For what kinds of measures is it useful/appropriate?
	* How can one determine in Stata how many observations have *missing values* of a particular variable?
	* Know how to read a *bar graph* (frequency or percent), and how to produce one in Stata. For what kind of measure is a bar graph appropriate?
	* Know how to read a *pie graph*, and how to produce one. For what kind of measure is a pie graph appropriate?
	* What do the terms *mutually exclusive* and *collectively exhaustive* mean?

* Describing quantitative data:
	* Know how to read a *histogram*, and how to produce one in Stata. For what kind of measure is a histogram appropriate? For what kind of variable is a histogram not appropriate?
	* Know how to read a *stem-and-leaf* display, and how to produce one in Stata.
	* What is a *symmetric distribution*? What does it mean for a distribution to be *right skewed* or *left skewed*? Be able to recognize symmetry/skewness from a histogram (and later, from a boxplot).

* Central tendency:
	* Know how the following measures are defined, and be prepared to calculate them, given relevant data: *mean, median, mode*. Also know how to find these using Stata.
	* Know when the use of each central tendency measure is appropriate to use.
	* How does one take a weighted average of group means to find the overall mean? 
	* What does the mean of a *dichotomous* (0-1) variable tell you?
	* When will the median of a distribution be smaller than its mean? Larger than its mean? Be able to identify such cases in a histogram, boxplot, or other distributional graph.

* Basic properties of the summation operator; carrying out a double summation
