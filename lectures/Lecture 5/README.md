# Lecture 5: Sampling distributions

## Topics covered:

* Explain in words why sample statistics such as x&#772; (the sample mean) calculated from a random sample are themselves random variables.

* What is meant by *sampling error* or *sampling variability*?

* *Central Limit Theorem*: If a random variable *x* has a normal distribution, describe the distribution of x&#772; (the mean of a random sample from this population), assuming σ is known. (i.e. what is its shape, its mean, and standard deviation)?

* What is the *standard error* of x&#772; (in words, and how is it calculated), assuming σ is known? 

* *Central Limit Theorem*: If a random variable *x* does not have a normal distribution, describe the distribution of x&#772; (the mean of a random sample from this population), assuming σ is known. Why is this result so useful for statistical practice?

* Be able to use information about the sampling distribution of x&#772; to calculate the probability of obtaining a random sample with a mean that is higher or lower than some specific value (or, between two specific values).

* Be able to use information about the sampling distribution of x&#772; to calculate the sample size necessary for the standard error to be of a certain size. 

* What does it mean for a sample statistic to be *unbiased*? Is x&#772; unbiased? Why or why not?

* What does it mean for one sample statistic to be more *efficient* than another?

* For sample proportions &pi;&#770;: what does the sampling distribution look like, assuming a large enough sample size? That is, what is its shape, mean and standard deviation/ standard error?

* Be able to use information about the sampling distribution of &pi; to calculate the probability of obtaining a random sample with a proportion $\hat{pi}$ ̂that is higher or lower than some specific value (or, between two specific values).

* Simulating sampling distributions in Stata: know how to sample repeatedly from population data and create a dataset of the results. See the handout "Useful Stata Commands for Simulation" in the Stata resources folder for a full description of related Stata commands.
