# Lecture 8: Statistical power and effect size

## Topics covered:

* What are *Type I Errors* and *Type II Errors*?  How are Type I Errors and α related?

* Explain in words what the "probability of a Type I error" (α) and "probability of a Type II error" (β) refer to.

* What (in words) is the *Power of the Test* for a specific alternative hypothesis? What kinds of things affect the power of the test? Why is a specific alternative hypothesis necessary in order to compute the power of the test? What is the generally accepted level of "good" power?

* Be able to use the online power applet and Stata to calculate the probability of a Type II error and the Power of the Test, given necessary information (including a specific alternative).

* Be able to use Stata to find the minimum required sample size in order to detect a given effect size (difference between the alternative and null hypotheses).

* What is the difference between *statistical significance* and *practical significance*? What is an "effect size," in words? How do you calculate the "Cohen’s d" measure of effect size?

* Explain how differences that are neither practically nor statistically significant can still provide valuable information (e.g., a "precise zero").

* There are lots of ways to communicate the results of inferential statistics: using test statistics and/or p-values, by indicating statistical significance, and by reporting confidence intervals. What are the pros/cons of each approach?

	Note: zero and the point estimate are often not the only values of interest. Having information about the *strength* of the evidence against the null can be useful, as well as the set of parameter values that the data are consistent with. 

* How should one benchmark effect sizes in order to determine whether they are practically significant or not? What are some of the benchmarks that are frequently used in education? Based on his review, what does Kraft consider to be a *large* effect in education?
