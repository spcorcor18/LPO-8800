# Lecture 7: Statistical inference--significance tests

## Topics covered:

* What is a *null hypothesis* (H<sub>0</sub>)? What is an *alternative hypothesis* (H<sub>1</sub>)? Given a sample research question, determine what the null and alternative hypotheses should be.

* What does it mean to *reject* the null hypothesis, in words? To "not reject?" Why should we never say we "accept" the null hypothesis or that the null hypothesis is "true"?

* What is the difference between a *one-sided* (directional) hypothesis test and a *two-sided* (non-directional) hypothesis test?

* Be able to perform a *one-sided hypothesis* test for a population mean (e.g., H<sub>0</sub>: μ=0 vs. H<sub>1</sub>: μ>0 or μ<0), under the assumption σ is known or σ is unknown. Compute the *test statistic*, find the *p-value* for your test statistic, and conclude whether H<sub>0</sub> should be rejected or not. (If σ is known, use the standard normal *z* distribution; if σ is unknown, use the *t* distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom).

* What (in words) is a *p-value*?

* What is the *significance level* of a hypothesis test (α)? Where does it come from? Is it something you calculate? What does it mean for the result of a test to be "statistically significant?" For a test to be "significant at the α=0.05 (5%) level"?

* Be able to perform a *one-sided* hypothesis test for a population *proportion* π (e.g. H<sub>0</sub>: π=0.6 vs. H<sub>1</sub>: π>0.6 or π<0.6). Compute the *test statistic*, find the *p-value* for your test statistic, and conclude whether H<sub>0</sub> should be rejected or not.

* Be able to perform a *two-sided* hypothesis test for a population mean or proportion (e.g. H<sub>0</sub>: μ=0, H<sub>1</sub>: μ≠0), under the assumption σ is known or σ is unknown.
.
* Be able to construct a 95% (or 90%, 99%) confidence interval and then use this confidence interval to perform a two-sided hypothesis test. Why does this approach yield the same conclusion as a two-sided hypothesis test decided with a *p* value?

* Know how to use Stata to conduct a hypothesis test for a population mean or proportion (ttest, or alternatively mean if you want to use a confidence interval to test a 2-sided hypothesis).
