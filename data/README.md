## LPO-8800 data

This folder contains data files used in the course. You can open the Stata .dta files here directly from stata using syntax like the following:

`use https://github.com/spcorcor18/LPO-8800/raw/main/data/filename.dta, clear`

Replace *filename* with the name of the file you wish to open in Stata. Since URLs cannot contain spaces, if there are any spaces in the filename you should replace them with %20 (e.g. school%20data.dta).
